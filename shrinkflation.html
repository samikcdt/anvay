            <div class="desc">
              <h4 class="md-mb-3">Abstract</h4>
              <p>In today's world of tight budgets and economic ups and downs, <strong>"shrinkflation"</strong> is a hot topic. It's all
                about how businesses make products smaller but don't lower the price. They do this to keep their
                profits up when making things cost more. This paper looks into shrinkflation, its history, and what
                it means for consumers. We'll also see how, strangely, shrinkflation can sometimes help consumers.
                We'll look at how shrinkflation and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) are connected. So, let's dive
                into this sneaky economic trick.</p>

    <section class="section-space alt-section">
      <div class="container">
        <h5 class="md-mb-3 subtitle">What's Shrinkflation?</h5>
        <p>A good example of shrinkflation is: a chocolate bar that was 100 grams might now be 90 grams but
          costs the same. These tiny changes can add up for consumers and the economy.</p>

        <h5 class="md-mb-3 subtitle">How Did Shrinkflation Start?</h5>
        <p>Shrinkflation, a term that emerged as consumers began to notice products getting smaller, has a
          long history in the business world. While its origins are unclear, companies have been utilizing
          this strategy for quite some time, and its popularity has surged in response to economic challenges.
          Consumers have become accustomed to these size reductions, making it an attractive option for
          companies seeking to discreetly manage rising production costs. This economic maneuver relates to
          how products are bought and sold and is closely linked to the state of the economy. In prosperous
          economic times, businesses can command higher prices for their products. However, during
          economic downturns when production costs increase, raising prices significantly is not a viable
          option as consumers would resist. This is when shrinkflation becomes a valuable tool, enabling
          companies to maintain profitability even as their costs escalate.</p>

        <h5 class="md-mb-3 subtitle">Why Is It Happening More?</h5>
        <p>The rise of shrinkflation has to do with a bunch of money factors. Stuff like higher costs for
          materials, energy, workers, and getting things from one place to another has made companies reduce
          the amount of stuff you get in a product. Inflation is when things get more expensive, and problems
          in the supply chain are making it worse. Companies don't want to raise prices too much because
          consumers will stop buying, so they pick shrinkflation instead. It's even more common during times
          of high inflation.</p>

        <h5 class="md-mb-3 subtitle">How Shrinkflation Works</h5>
        <p>Shrinkflation isn't the same for everything. Companies use it differently for various products. They
          make things smaller, have less of it, or skimp on the quality of the product. This happens with many
          things we buy, from food and drinks to stuff in our homes and electronics. The changes are so tiny
          that people might not notice them right away.</p>

        <h5 class="md-mb-3 subtitle">Why It Can Be Good for You</h5>
        <p>You might think shrinkflation is all bad, but there are times when it's good for consumers.
          Companies do it to avoid raising prices. This means you might get less of something, but it won't
          cost you more. You still get the same product at the same price you're used to. When the other
          choice is a big price hike, shrinkflation can be better for your wallet.</p>

        <h5 class="md-mb-3 subtitle">How Your Brain Plays a Part</h5>
        <p>Shrinkflation has a lot to do with how people think. In many cases, you won't notice a small change
          in the size of a product. That's because shrinkflation is sneaky. Small reductions in size or quantity
          might not catch your eye until you look closely at the packaging. Long-standing products often
          provoke the strongest customer backlash when they undergo size reductions, as it contradicts the
          loyalty they have developed.</p>

        <p>People are more concerned about how much things cost rather than how big or small they are.
          That's why they're more likely to spot price increases than changes in product size. What's going on
          in your head has a big role in why shrinkflation works.</p>

        <h5 class="md-mb-3 subtitle">Where You See Shrinkflation</h5>
        <p>Shrinkflation isn't limited to just one type of product. It happens in a bunch of industries. Food and
          drinks are big targets for shrinkflation, especially when the cost of materials goes up. Household
          items like cleaning stuff and paper goods get smaller too. Electronics makers sometimes reduce
          quality while keeping prices steady. It's not everywhere, but shrinkflation happens in a lot of
          places. Whether it's toilet roll or a bag of crisps, the practice, which mostly happens during times
          of inflation, shows up in shops around the world. Recently, French supermarket Carrefour put
          stickers on products to warn consumers when a packet's contents have gotten smaller without a
          corresponding price decrease.</p>

        <h5 class="md-mb-3 subtitle">What Others Say</h5>
        <p>To understand shrinkflation better, we need to look at what experts and research say. They've
          studied how people react to shrinkflation, how it impacts the economy, and what it does to things
          like the CPI.</p>

        <h5 class="md-mb-3 subtitle">What the Experts Say</h5>
        <p>Experts have looked at shrinkflation from all angles. They study how people act, what it does to
          the economy, and how it shows up in things like the CPI. They found that most people don't notice
          small changes in the size of a product. They care more about the price going up. This sneaky nature
          helps companies keep making money without upsetting customers.</p>

        <h5 class="md-mb-3 subtitle">Reports from the Field</h5>
        <p>Reports about shrinkflation look at how common it is in different industries, especially in food and
          drinks. They talk about why companies use shrinkflation, like the cost of making things and how
          much other companies charge. Learning about the challenges in each industry helps us understand
          why shrinkflation is happening. A few historical examples of shrinkflation include: Consumers used
          to buy coffee in a 1-pound can. But a 1988 report shows that the brand Chock full o'Nuts® reduced
          the amount of their coffee in a 1-pound can to 13 ounces; by 2003, the brand had further reduced
          it to 11 ounces of coffee. Similarly, ice cream businesses used to sell their ice cream in 64-ounce
          containers. Then, beginning around 2008, they shrunk their containers to 48 ounces.</p>

        <h5 class="md-mb-3 subtitle">Expert Opinions</h5>
        <p>US-based Mark Stiving, the chief pricing educator at Impact Pricing, an organisation that educates
          companies on pricing, says companies use shrinkflation to raise prices <strong>"less painfully"</strong>. According to
          Edgar Dworsky, a former US consumer rights lawyer and founder of Consumer World, a recurring
          pattern emerges: When products get smaller due to shrinkflation, manufacturers respond by introducing
          new, larger versions with creative names, leading consumers to pay higher prices. This trend is evident
          in products like toilet paper, which has been shrinking for decades. As rolls reduce in size and become
          noticeable to consumers, manufacturers introduce larger sizes and label them as <strong>"double", "triple" or
            "mega"</strong> rolls. Even in today's era of shrinkflation, Charmin's <strong>"super mega"</strong> rolls are also diminishing
          in size

        <h3 class="section-title text-center">The Connection Between Shrinkflation and the Consumer Price Index (CPI)</h3>
        <h5 class="md-mb-3 subtitle">What's the CPI?</h5>
        <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a big deal in economics. It's a way to see how the cost of living
          is changing over time. The CPI looks at how much we're paying for things like food, clothes,
          housing, and getting around. It's important for a few reasons.</p>

        <p>First, it helps people, companies, and policymakers know how the cost of living is going up. This
          helps them plan their money, budgets, and what they need to do.</p>

        <p>Second, big banks, like the Federal Reserve, use the CPI to make money decisions. If things cost too
          much, they might raise interest rates to keep it in check. On the other hand, they could lower rates to
          make people spend more if costs aren't going up enough.</p>

        <p>Lastly, lots of stuff, like government programs, jobs, and retirement plans, are connected to the CPI.
          This makes sure payments and wages keep up with prices, so people can still buy what they need.</p>

        <h5 class="md-mb-3 subtitle">Shrinkflation and the CPI</h5>
        <p>Shrinkflation and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) are linked because they both deal with the price
          and size of things people buy. The CPI looks at how the prices of a fixed set of goods and services
          change over time. It's all about measuring inflation, or how much prices are going up. So when
          companies use shrinkflation, the cost of the stuff you buy goes up even if the price isn't changing.
          This messes with the CPI because it makes it look like things are getting more expensive than they
          are. That's why we need smart folks to adjust the CPI to show the real inflation rate. CPI economists
          track identified downsizing and upsizing in the CPI sample each month. Chart 1 illustrates the item
          categories in the CPI sample that exhibited the highest number of both decreases and increases
          in observations from January 2015 to December 2021. Among these categories, household paper
          products demonstrated more instances of both upsizing and downsizing than any other.</p>

        <h5 class="md-mb-3 subtitle">Fixing the CPI</h5>
        <p>To make sure the CPI tells the truth about inflation, economists make some changes. They check
          products for size changes and report what they find. Then, they figure out the price for a standard
          amount, like an ounce or a pound, to account for the size changes. This helps the CPI show the right
          price changes for consumers.</p>

        <h5 class="md-mb-3 subtitle">How Much It Matters</h5>
        <p>Shrinkflation might seem like a big deal when it happens to one product, but it doesn't do much
          to the overall inflation rate. It's like a speck on the whole inflation picture. Shrinkflation has about
          a 0.01% impact on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) every year. So, while you might spot it in a
          product here and there, it doesn't shake up the whole economy.</p>

        <h5 class="md-mb-3 subtitle">Conclusion</h5>
        <p>Shrinkflation is a sneaky trick that businesses use to deal with rising costs. You might feel the pinch
          when your favorite stuff gets smaller, but it's better than paying way more for it. Shrinkflation is
          about finding a balance between making money and keeping customers happy.</p>

        <p>The small changes in product size can be hard to spot, but they're all part of the game. Your focus is
          usually on how much things cost rather than how much you're getting. That's why companies can
          pull off shrinkflation.</p>

        <p>The practice of shrinkflation messes with the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is important in
          the world of money. The CPI helps us understand how much we need for everyday things. When
          shrinkflation makes stuff more expensive, it makes the CPI look like prices are shooting up. But
          smart folks are on the case, making sure the CPI tells us the real story.</p>

        <p>In the end, shrinkflation is a unique way that businesses cope with financial ups and downs while
          still delivering products to you. As we move through this complicated world of money and business,
          shrinkflation keeps things interesting for researchers, economists, and everyone who's out there
          shopping.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title text-center">Growing Awareness and Future Implications</h3>
        <p>Consumer awareness of shrinkflation is on the rise, fueled by news, consumer groups, and social
          media. Shoppers are becoming more vigilant, scrutinizing product sizes and making comparisons.
          This increased awareness is pressuring companies to be more transparent.</p>

        <p>While consumer groups play a crucial role in this trend, it's part of a broader movement where
          people demand fairness and openness from businesses. However, spotting shrinkflation remains
          challenging. The practice is subtle, and size reductions can go unnoticed, especially when packaging
          changes accompany them.</p>

        <p>To address this, governments and consumer protection groups are taking action. They aim to
          ensure consumers are informed when products change, potentially through clearer product labels
          or regulations on allowable size reductions. These measures are intended to safeguard consumer
          interests and promote fairness in the marketplace.</p>

        <p>Looking ahead, shrinkflation is likely here to stay, with its impact influenced by consumer
          perception, regulations, and economic conditions. As consumer awareness continues to grow,
          companies may adopt more transparent approaches to communicate size changes, attributing
          them to factors like inflation. They may also compensate for reduced sizes with additional product
          features.</p>

        <p>Governments and consumer agencies will maintain efforts to keep consumers informed, enforce
          clear labeling, and ensure fairness in business practices. Shrinkflation's prevalence may fluctuate
          with economic ups and downs, as it remains a strategy for companies to maintain profits while
          keeping prices stable.</p>

        <p>In summary, the future of shrinkflation will be shaped by consumer perceptions, regulatory
          developments, and economic factors, reflecting the ongoing adaptation of businesses and consumers
          in the modern marketplace. While it may be a subtle aspect of shopping, shrinkflation adds an
          intriguing dimension to the consumer experience.</p>

        <p>Table 1 displays the total index difference between the published CPI and the research indexes for all the
          commodity and services index and for the eight major groups in the CPI from 2015-19. The all commodity
          and services index shows a total difference between the published CPI and the research index of 0.05
          percent over 5 years, which indicates that product size changes (upsizing and downsizing) increased the
          CPI all commodity and services index by 0.01 percent per year. The food and beverages index showed
          the largest difference (+0.21 percent), followed by housing (+0.05 percent) and other goods and services
          (+0.02 percent). The indexes for apparel, education and communication, medical care, recreation, and
          transportation showed no difference at the major group level. <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-12/measuring-shrinkflation-and-its-impact-on-inflation.htm" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

        <p>Table 2 focuses on the indexes where downsizing and upsizing significantly impacted item categories.
          Indexes that experienced the largest price increase due to downsizing were baby food (+2.81 percent);
          snacks (+2.64 percent); fresh biscuits, rolls, muffins (+1.59 percent); candy and chewing gum (+1.35
          percent), and household paper products (+1.30 percent). Snacks, such as potato chips, saw frequent
          downsizing of their snack packs from 4.5 oz. to 4.25 oz. and an 8 oz. bag declining to 7.5 oz.
          Conversely, canned fruits and vegetables saw an increase in the research index as the effective price
          decrease due to upsizing was removed from the research indexes. The average total difference across all
          categories during the time period was 0.08 percent</p>

        <p>Chart 1 displays the item categories with the most downsized and upsized observations in the CPI
          sample from January 2015 to December 2021. Household paper products experienced upsizing and
          downsizing more than any other category in the sample with 716 total reports during 2015-21. While
          that sounds substantial, it is only about 3 percent of the price observations for that category during the
          7-year period. Snacks experienced the largest number of size changes for food items, with a total of
          509, followed by sweetrolls, coffee cake, and donuts, tea and pies, tarts, and turnovers. For food items,
          2.9 percent of observed prices experienced downsizing and upsizing.</p>

        <p>Chart 2 shows the total reports of upsized and downsized items for each month in the CPI sample
          from 2015-21. For context, there are approximately 100,000 goods and services priced each month
          in the CPI. Early 2015 and 2016 observed the highest number of reports for downsized items. During
          that time, potato chips, baby food, and paper towels saw a significant amount of downsizing.</p>
