                <h5 class="md-mb-3 subtitle">Steps</h5>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Water Sources : </strong> The process begins with the identification and sourcing of water from
                        natural sources such as rivers, lakes, reservoirs, or groundwater aquifers. In the case of
                        Nagpur, water is often sourced from the Kanhan and Pench reservoirs.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Water Intake and Extraction : </strong> Water is drawn from these sources through intake
                        structures and wells. This raw water often contains impurities and contaminants and needs
                        treatment before it can be distributed as drinking water.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Water Treatment : </strong> The raw water undergoes a series of treatment processes at water
                        treatment plants. These processes typically include:

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Coagulation and Flocculation : </strong> Chemicals are added to the water to bind impurities
                                and particles together.</li>

                            <li><strong>Sedimentation : </strong> The water is allowed to settle, causing particles to settle at the
                                bottom.</li>

                            <li><strong>Filtration : </strong> The water is passed through filters (usually sand or other media) to
                                remove remaining particles.</li>

                            <li><strong>Disinfection : </strong> Chlorine or other disinfectants are added to kill bacteria and
                                pathogens.</li>

                            <li><strong>pH Adjustment : </strong> The pH of the water is adjusted to ensure it meets health and safety
                                standards.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Water Storage : </strong> After treatment, the water is stored in reservoirs or tanks. These storage
                        facilities help ensure a continuous and reliable supply of water, even during periods of high
                        demand or maintenance.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Distribution Network : </strong> A network of pipelines and distribution channels carries the treated
                        water from storage facilities to various parts of the city. The distribution system typically
                        includes pipes of varying sizes, pump stations to maintain pressure, and valves to control
                        flow.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Water Quality Monitoring : </strong> Water quality is continuously monitored throughout the
                        distribution system. Sensors and testing points check for factors like chlorine levels, turbidity,
                        and bacteriological quality to ensure that the water remains safe for consumption.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Metering and Billing : </strong> In many modern systems, water meters are installed at residential
                        and commercial properties to measure water usage accurately. Bills are generated based on
                        these meter readings.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Emergency Response : </strong> Water supply systems are equipped to respond to emergencies
                        such as leaks or pipe bursts quickly. Maintenance and repairs are carried out as needed to
                        minimize service interruptions.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Water Conservation and Education : </strong> Water authorities often engage in public awareness
                        campaigns to promote responsible water usage and conservation among residents.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Water Quality Compliance : </strong> The water supply system must comply with local, national,
                        and international water quality standards and regulations to ensure that the water supplied is
                        safe for drinking.
                    </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The goal of a well-designed water supply system is to provide a consistent and potable
                        water supply to meet the needs of the population while prioritizing public health and
                        sustainability. Ongoing maintenance, infrastructure upgrades, and investment in technology
                        are essential to the efficient operation of such systems.</p>

                <p>It's crucial for OCW, its employees, and stakeholders to adhere to all applicable laws,
                    regulations, and contractual obligations to maintain legal and ethical integrity. Violating the
                    law can result in penalties, fines, legal actions, and damage to the reputation of the
                    organization. Therefore, OCW should have policies, procedures, and compliance measures
                    in place to prevent and detect illegal acts, and it should cooperate with law enforcement and
                    regulatory authorities when necessary.</p>

                <p>Nagpur's water supply and distribution system, managed by Orange City Water Limited
                    (OCW), is a dynamic example of the challenges and opportunities in the field of water
                    management. As a public-private partnership, OCW strives to provide uninterrupted access
                    to clean and treated water, emphasizing water quality, and deploying modern technologies
                    for efficient distribution. The economics of OCW are built around revenue generation, cost
                    management, and financial sustainability, with tariff structures designed to balance the
                    interests of various customer categories. However, the system is subject to a complex web
                    of external acts and must rigorously adhere to legal and regulatory frameworks.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, engaging in illegal acts within this framework can have severe consequences,
                    from legal penalties to reputational damage. The success of OCW in delivering a
                    sustainable, high-quality water supply to Nagpur hinges on its commitment to compliance,
                    responsible governance, and community engagement. Nagpur's waterworks system serves as a valuable case study in the pursuit of water security, economic viability, and ethical
                    stewardship, offering insights that extend far beyond this rapidly growing city in India.</p>
